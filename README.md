Local Library website written in Express (Node)

This repository contains source code(including challenges) from the [MDN Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) Local Library Website.

I saw this tutorial from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs) which is a cool website for new web developers.
